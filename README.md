# The Sculptor

[![Push Dev](https://github.com/shiroyashik/sculptor/actions/workflows/dev-release.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/shiroyashik/sculptor/actions/workflows/dev-release.yml)

Unofficial backend for the Minecraft mod [Figura](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura).

Is a worthy replacement for the official version. Realized all the functionality that can be used during the game.

And also a distinctive feature is the possibility of player identification through third-party authentication providers (such as [Ely.By](https://ely.by/))

## Public server

[![Server status](https://up.shsr.ru/api/badge/1/status?upLabel=Online&downLabel=Offline&label=Server+status)](https://up.shsr.ru/status/pub)

I'm keeping the public server running at the moment!

You can use it if running your own Sculptor instance is difficult for you.

To connect, simply change **IP Server** in Figura settings to the address below:

> figura.shsr.ru

Authentication is enabled on the server via: Mojang and [Ely.By](https://ely.by/)

For reasons beyond my control, the server is not available in some countries.


## Launch

To run it you will need a configured reverse proxy server.

Make sure that the reverse proxy you are using supports WebSocket and valid certificates are used for HTTPS connections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NGINX requires additional configuration to work with websocket!

### Docker

For the template you can use [docker-compose.example.yml](docker-compose.example.yml)

It assumes you will be using Traefik as a reverse proxy, if so uncomment the lines and add Sculptor to the network with Traefik.

Copy [Config.example.toml](Config.example.toml) change the settings as desired and rename to Config.toml

That's enough to start Sculptor.

### Pre-Built
